# Nozawa Onsen 13 Public Baths - Tourist Descriptions

## 1. Oyu (大湯) - The Grand Bath
**Temperature: Hot (with mild option)**

The iconic symbol of Nozawa Onsen, Oyu stands at the village center with its beautiful Edo-period wooden architecture that has welcomed bathers for centuries. This largest and most photographed bathhouse features two pools - an intensely hot "atsuyu" and a slightly cooler "nuruyu" - though even the mild bath can feel scalding to newcomers. The simple sulfur waters are believed to help with digestive issues, rheumatism, and diabetes, making this the perfect introduction to Nozawa's bathing culture. As the most accessible and tourist-friendly bath, it's an essential first stop on any onsen pilgrimage.

Oyu serves as the social heart of the village where locals have gathered for their daily baths since the days of the samurai, creating a living connection to Japan's bathing traditions. Directly opposite the bathhouse, you'll find a free foot bath (ashiyu) perfect for those not ready for the full experience. Early morning visits (6-8 AM) offer the best chance to experience Oyu with fewer crowds, though joining the evening rush provides authentic insight into village life. The name "Oyu" literally means "honorable hot water," reflecting its status as the village's most revered bathing spot.

**Local Tip:** Start with the "nuruyu" (mild) side even if you're confident with hot water - locals know that Oyu's supposedly mild bath is hotter than most other village baths' regular temperatures. The free foot bath across the street is perfect for testing your heat tolerance first.

## 2. Kawahara-yu (河原湯) - Riverside Bath
**Temperature: Very Hot**

Originally located in a riverside hollow that gave it its name, Kawahara-yu sits just below Oyu and maintains its reputation for extremely hot water that locals particularly favor for morning soaks. The simple sulfur spring water here is especially prized for treating skin conditions. With its traditional atmosphere and stone floors, this compact bathhouse offers an authentic local experience, though the high temperature (sourced at 60°C) makes it challenging for those unaccustomed to Japanese hot springs.

**Local Tip:** This bath is notoriously hot even by Nozawa standards. Visit early morning (before 7 AM) when locals say it's "best for morning baths" - though we suspect this is partly because fewer people have added cold water yet. Summer visits are more manageable than winter.

## 3. Akiha-no-yu (秋葉の湯)
**Temperature: Hot**

Tucked near the tranquil Ibanoyama Bunko park, Akiha-no-yu offers a serene escape with its solid traditional construction and distinctive tiled bathtub floor. The gypsum-salt-sulfur spring water is valued for treating gastrointestinal ailments, rheumatism, and women's health issues. The separate enclosed changing area makes this particularly comfortable during cold, snowy days.

**Local Tip:** The enclosed changing room (rare in Nozawa's public baths) makes this a winter favorite. The tiled floor rather than wood is easier on the feet and less slippery - though specific visiting patterns aren't well documented for tourists.

## 4. Taki-no-yu (滝の湯) - Waterfall Bath
**Temperature: Very Hot**

Located high on the hillside near the Ogama source, this charming wooden bathhouse draws from the hottest spring at 78°C, creating distinctive greenish waters rich in minerals. Known for helping those recovering from serious illness, Taki-no-yu offers a more rustic experience than the grand Oyu. **Important: Currently restricted to village accommodation guests only.** When accessible, its high mineral content creates abundant "yunohana" (bath flowers) floating in the therapeutic waters.

The restriction to "village guests" means you must be staying at accommodation within Nozawa Onsen village to use this bath - day visitors from nearby towns cannot enter. Those fortunate enough to gain access often consider Taki-no-yu the finest bath in the village due to its proximity to the Ogama source, which provides the freshest, most mineral-rich waters. The name "waterfall bath" comes not from any actual waterfall, but from the powerful flow of hot spring water that cascades into the tub. Local lore suggests that the closer a bath is to the source, the stronger its healing powers.

**Local Tip:** If you're staying in the village, visit between 5-8 PM (winter hours: 6-9 PM) for the best chance of experiencing this bath with locals who consider it the most therapeutic. The greenish water color and floating minerals indicate the highest mineral content - though verify current access rules with your accommodation.

## 5. Kuma-no-tearai-yu (熊の手洗湯) - Bear's Handwashing Bath
**Temperature: Mild**

Legend tells of an injured bear that led a hunter to this ancient spring, where it healed its wounds in the therapeutic waters - making this possibly Nozawa's oldest discovered bath. At 40-43°C, it offers the mildest temperatures of all the public baths, perfect for those who find the others too hot. The simple sulfur water has a gentle greenish tint and is particularly effective for burns, cuts, and skin healing. An egg cooking station near the entrance lets you prepare onsen tamago while you soak.

This is the ideal "starter bath" for tourists new to Japanese hot springs, as the mild temperature allows for longer, more comfortable soaking while your body adjusts to the mineral-rich waters. The bear legend dates back over 1,000 years, and locals still refer to the bath as "Kuma-no-yu" (Bear's Bath) in casual conversation. The egg cooking station here produces particularly delicious onsen tamago - place your eggs in the netted basket and wait 20-25 minutes for the perfect soft-boiled consistency. Many visitors make this their first stop to start cooking eggs, explore other baths, then return to collect their perfectly cooked breakfast.

**Local Tip:** This is the only bath where you can comfortably soak for 20+ minutes without overheating. Start your eggs cooking here first (20-25 minutes), visit 2-3 other nearby baths, then return for both your eggs and a relaxing final soak. The greenish tint to the water is natural and indicates good mineral content.

## 6. Matsuba-no-yu (松葉の湯)
**Temperature: Hot**

This distinctive two-story building showcases temple-style architecture perched on a stone foundation, with the bath located upstairs and a traditional laundry facility below. Named after a historical archery range that once stood here (the name evolved from "matoba" meaning target), the simple sulfur waters share similar healing properties to the nearby Asagama source. The entrance features an egg cooking station where you can prepare traditional onsen eggs while enjoying the historic atmosphere.

**Local Tip:** The laundry on the first floor is still actively used by locals - don't mistake it for the bath entrance! Head upstairs for bathing. The egg cooking station at the entrance is one of the village's most reliable. Note: Limited information exists about specific visiting patterns for this bath.

## 7. Nakao-no-yu (中尾の湯)
**Temperature: Very Hot**

Boasting the largest wooden structure among all Nozawa's public baths, Nakao-no-yu impresses with its spacious interior featuring both hot and lukewarm pools to suit different preferences. The sulfur-sodium-calcium-sulfate spring water, drawn from the famous Ogama source at approximately 65°C, is renowned for treating skin ailments, rheumatism, and women's health issues. The generous bathing area and high ceilings create an open, relaxing atmosphere that can comfortably accommodate larger groups.

Located in a residential area away from the tourist center, Nakao-no-yu offers a more authentic local experience with fewer foreign visitors. The two-pool system allows bathers to start in the lukewarm pool before challenging themselves with the hotter bath, though even the "mild" pool here would be considered very hot by international standards. Evening visits often mean sharing the bath with local families who have used these waters for generations, providing genuine cultural exchange opportunities. The impressive wooden beams and traditional carpentry visible throughout the structure showcase the craftsmanship that has maintained these buildings for centuries.

**Local Tip:** Despite having two pools labeled hot and lukewarm, both are quite hot - the "lukewarm" pool is where locals go first to adjust. Its location away from the center means it's rarely crowded, making it perfect for a peaceful evening soak with neighborhood residents.

## 8. Shin-yu (新湯) - New Bath
**Temperature: Hot**

Despite its name meaning "new bath," Shin-yu has served the community for generations, most recently renovated in 2006 to reveal a beautiful interior where abundant "yunohana" (mineral deposits) create a natural wonder. The simple sulfur spring water mysteriously changes color with the seasons - from milky white to pale blue to greenish tints - while maintaining its effectiveness for hemorrhoids and conditions that benefit from deep warming. Note the shorter operating hours (6:00-22:00) and prepare for water around 55°C that locals consider "mild."

**Local Tip:** Visit in different seasons to see the water's color changes - winter tends toward milky white while summer can be blue-green. The abundant yunohana (mineral flowers) floating in the water indicates high mineral content. Closes earlier than most baths at 22:00 (10 PM).

## 9. Asagama-no-yu (麻釜の湯)
**Temperature: Hot**

Drawing its waters from the famous Asagama hot spring source, this bathhouse on Asagama Street features a unique mineral composition of Glauber's salt, gypsum, and sulfur believed to help with hemorrhoids, diabetes, rheumatism, and neuralgia. The thin white water contains visible yunohana particles that float like snow. Behind the building, you can glimpse the traditional communal laundry area still used by locals, offering insight into how hot spring water remains integral to daily village life.

**Local Tip:** The communal laundry area behind the building is still actively used - it's fascinating to watch but don't disturb the washing. The white yunohana particles are particularly abundant here. However, specific local bathing patterns or optimal times aren't well documented for tourists.

## 10. Kamitera-yu (上寺湯)
**Temperature: Hot**

This historic bathhouse, located just downhill from Shin-yu, draws its therapeutic waters from the Asagama source, creating a gypsum-salt-sulfur spring particularly renowned for treating cuts, burns, and various skin conditions. With deep roots in the village's bathing culture, Kamitera-yu offers an authentic local experience in a modest setting. The mineral-rich waters leave skin feeling notably soft and refreshed.

**Local Tip:** One source mentioned this bath can be "so hot in the morning, I couldn't even dip my toes in!" - suggesting afternoon or evening visits might be more manageable. The modest size means it's intimate but can feel crowded with more than 4-5 people.

## 11. Yokochi-no-yu (横落の湯)
**Temperature: Very Hot**

Hidden beneath the Yokochi traffic lights intersection, this unique underground bathhouse requires descending stairs marked by distinctive stone walls to reach the subterranean bathing chambers. The sulfur-sodium-calcium-sulfate waters drawn from the Asagama source are considered especially effective for skin diseases. The basement location provides a consistent temperature year-round and an intimate, cave-like atmosphere that feels worlds away from the street level above.

Finding the entrance can be tricky for first-time visitors - look for the stone retaining wall at the traffic light intersection and follow the narrow stairway down. The underground location means Yokochi-no-yu maintains its heat exceptionally well, making it one of the consistently hottest baths even in winter. The unique subterranean setting creates an almost mystical atmosphere, with steam rising through the stairwell creating an otherworldly entrance. Despite being literally under the main road, the thick stone walls create a peaceful sanctuary isolated from the world above.

**Local Tip:** Look for the stone wall at the traffic lights - the entrance is easy to miss. The underground location keeps this bath consistently hot year-round. The men's bath has a square tub while the women's is circular, an unusual design quirk in Nozawa's baths.

## 12. Juoudou-no-yu (十王堂の湯) - Hall of Ten Kings
**Temperature: Hot**

This distinctive two-story western-style building stands out with its unusual arrangement: women bathe on the first floor while men climb to the second, reversing the typical Japanese bathhouse layout. Named after the nearby Enma-do Hall's ten Buddhist judges of the afterlife, the simple sulfur spring offers similar benefits to Oyu. Outside, you'll find both an egg cooking station and traditional laundry facilities still actively used by villagers, making this a wonderful spot to observe local life.

**Local Tip:** The reversed floor arrangement (women downstairs, men upstairs) is unique in Japan - don't get confused! The egg cooking station and laundry area outside offer great opportunities to interact with locals. Specific optimal visiting times aren't well documented.

## 13. Shinden-no-yu (真田の湯)
**Temperature: Hot**

Nestled behind Nishinomiya Shrine at the village's entrance, Shinden-no-yu opened during the late Edo period and was beautifully renovated in 2018, making it one of the most modern-feeling traditional baths. The sulfur-sodium-calcium-sulfate waters share the therapeutic properties of the famous Asagama source, particularly beneficial for hemorrhoids, diabetes, and rheumatism. Its location near the Shinden bus terminal makes it convenient for visitors arriving in the village, and many consider it an ideal final bath before departure.

**Local Tip:** Perfect as your first or last bath due to its location near the bus terminal. The 2018 renovation makes it one of the cleanest and most modern-feeling baths while maintaining traditional charm. It's also the closest bath to Villa Katashio accommodation.

### The Onsen Experience
These 13 public baths have been the heart of village life since the Edo period, maintained by neighborhood groups called "yunakama" who clean them daily and preserve centuries-old traditions. The 100% natural hot spring water flows continuously from source to bath without recycling or chemical treatment, offering an authentic therapeutic experience increasingly rare in modern Japan. While the lack of amenities and extreme heat can challenge first-timers, those who persevere discover why these waters have attracted pilgrims for over 700 years.
